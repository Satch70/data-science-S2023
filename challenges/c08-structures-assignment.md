*Purpose*: Most real problems have multiple sources of uncertainty mixed
together. Untangling these different sources can be challenging, even on
a conceptual level. In this challenge we’ll study a simple problem of
structural safety, and use this small case study to untangle sources of
sampling and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

*Note*: In this challenge I provide a lot of stub-code; you won’t have
to do too much coding. This is because I want you to *focus on answering
the conceptual questions*. The most important questions in this
challenge are: *What sources of uncertainty are you accounting for? What
sources are you not accounting for? Are those sources real or induced?*

*Background*: The
[strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength) of a
material is the amount of mechanical stress it can survive before
breaking. To illustrate: Stresses are internal forces that hold an
object together when we try to squeeze, stretch, or otherwise deform a
solid object. For instance, if we pull on a rectangular bar of material,
internal stresses $\sigma$ work to keep the bar together.

*Strength* is a measure of how much internal stress an object can
survive: A higher strength means a stronger material. This challenge’s
data are very simple: They are (synthetic) observations of ultimate
tensile strength (UTS) on individual samples of the same aluminum alloy.
The experiments were carried out following the higest standards of
experimental rigor, so you should consider these values to be the “true”
breaking strength for each sample.

**Observations**:

- What is the mean strength of the material, approximately?
  - It looks like it is approximately 40000 PSI.
- To what extent can you tell what shape the distribution of the data
  has?
  - The shape looks close to normal.
- Assuming the scopus is the strength of an individual part made from
  this aluminum alloy, is the observed variability real or induced?
  - It says these are the “true” breaking strength for each sample, due
    to the testing method, making it a real variability. But that is
    with the assumption that the process behind the testing is so
    accurate, that there is more variability within the metal then the
    testing of the strength.

# Assessing Structural Safety

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*Objective*: In this challenge you are going to study a structure and
assess its *probability of failure* (POF). A higher POF corresponds to a
more unsafe structure. Ultimately, we want

$$\text{POF} < 0.03.$$

Your job is to assess a given structure using the data provided and
determine whether you can *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`.

## Structural model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

The following code chunk sets up a structural model: We are considering
a rectangular bar under uniaxial tensile load (as pictured above). A
larger cross-sectional area `A` is capable of surviving a greater load
`L`, but a larger `A` is a heavier (more expensive) structure. The
internal stress is approximately `sigma = L / A`—we simply compare this
quantity against the strength.

I pick particular values for `A, L` and package all the information in
the *limit state function* `g_break`:

A \<- 0.0255 \# Cross-sectional area

L \<- 1000 \# Applied load (lbs)

g_break \<- function(strength) {

strength - L / A

}

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; model setup
A <- 0.0255 # Cross-sectional area
L <- 1000 # Applied load (lbs)

g_break <- function(strength) {
  strength - L / A
}
```

The *probability of failure* (POF) is then defined in terms of the limit
state $g$ via:

$$\text{POF} \equiv \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0].$$

### **q2** Using the observations in `df_samples` and the structural model `g_break()`, estimate the probability of failure.

*Hint*: In `c07-monte-carlo` you learned how to estimate a probability
as the `mean()` of an indicator. Use the same strategy here.

``` r
## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure; i.e. POF = Pr[g <= 0]

POF <- df_samples %>% 
  mutate(g_break = g_break(strength), POF = (g_break <= 0)) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(POF), sd = sd(POF))

POF
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 2
    ##    mean    sd
    ##   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1     0     0

**Observations**:

- Does this estimate satisfy `POF < 0.03`?
  - It does
- Is this estimate of the probability of failure trustworthy? Why or why
  not?
  - Following the model we were given and provided that the information
    was correct the probability of failure is trustworthy. The reason
    being we tested for 10000 possible simulations across the all
    different strengths, meaning that alloys with the weakest strengths
    passed the test.
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not.
  - The accuracy of the estimated POF depends on the sample size, the
    number of Monte Carlo simulations, and the representatives of the
    samples. Therefore, with the large number of simulations and the
    relative accurateness of the alloys strengths, I would say that I
    can conclude that the POF \< 0.03.

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Since we have so few physical samples, we will fit a distribution to
model the material property. This will give us the means to draw
“virtual samples” and use those to estimate the POF.

### **q3** Fit a lognormal distribution to the strength data using the `fitdistr()` function.

*Note*: In this challenge I generated the `strength` data from a
`lognormal` distribution; if you didn’t know that fact, then the choice
of distribution would be an *additional* source of uncertainty!

*Hint 1*: We learned how to do this in `e-stat08-fit-dist`.

*Hint 2*: The `fitdistr` function uses `densfun = "lognormal"` to
specify a lognormal distribution.

``` r
## TODO:
df_fit <- df_samples %>% 
  pull(strength) %>% 
  fitdistr(densfun =  "lognormal") %>% 
  tidy()
df_fit
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##   term    estimate std.error
    ##   <chr>      <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 meanlog 10.6       0.00175
    ## 2 sdlog    0.00875   0.00124

Once you’ve successfully fit a model for the strength, you can estimate
the probability of failure by drawing samples from the fitted
distribution.

### **q4** Complete the code below by 1. choosing a Monte Carlo sample size `n_monte_carlo`, 2. extracting the estimated parameters from q3, and 3. computing the limit state value `g = g_break()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint 1*: You will need to combine ideas from `c07-monte-carlo` and
`e-stat08-fit-dist` in order to complete this task.

*Hint 2*: The function `rlnorm()` will allow you to draw samples from a
lognormal distribution.

``` r
## TODO 1: Choose Monte Carlo sample size
set.seed(101)
n_monte_carlo <- 10000

## TODO 2: Extract parameter estimates from df_fit
strength_meanlog <- df_fit$estimate[1]
strength_sdlog <- df_fit$estimate[2]


# Generate samples
df_norm_sim <-
  tibble(strength = rlnorm(n_monte_carlo, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)) %>%
## TODO 3: Compute structural response
  mutate(g = g_break(strength)) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 10,000
    ## Columns: 2
    ## $ strength <dbl> 39825.59, 40132.92, 39704.18, 40014.36, 40048.13, 40351.78, 4…
    ## $ g        <dbl> 609.90304, 917.23381, 488.49651, 798.67352, 832.44520, 1136.0…

``` r
## NOTE: The following code estimates the POF and a 95% confidence interval
df_norm_pof <-
  df_norm_sim %>%
  mutate(stat = g <= 0) %>%
  summarize(
    pof_est = mean(stat),
    se = sd(stat) / sqrt(n_monte_carlo)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pof_lo = pof_est - 1.96 * se,
    pof_hi = pof_est + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  select(pof_lo, pof_est, pof_hi)

df_norm_pof
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   pof_lo pof_est pof_hi
    ##    <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 0.0142  0.0167 0.0192

- Assuming your scopus is the probability of failure `POF` defined
  above, does your estimate exhibit real variability, induced
  variability, or both?

  - We have the initial fact that there is real variability within the
    original metals but then we add on the induced variability when we
    draw the samples from the fitted distribution. Since it is not the
    whole set and we are taking a model that we fit to the original
    data, we have induced variability into the process.

- Does this confidence interval imply that `POF < 0.03`?

  - Yes it does because the interval is 0.014 - 0.019.

- Compare this probability with your estimate from q2; is it more or
  less trustworthy?

  - I believe this estimate is more accurate for a few reasons. One is
    that even though we have induced variability by fitting a model, we
    have also given more “samples” to test giving us more data and
    points, which allows us to see more scenarios and to test for more
    scenarios. That leads me to the second reason, which is since we can
    test for more scenarios we can develop more accurate estimates of
    what pieces may or may not fail.

- ## Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from the *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?

- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?

  - It does because by fitting the curve and taking samples from that
    curve it allows for us to account for possibilities we don’t see in
    the set.

- What could you do to tighten up the confidence interval?

  - We could make the confidence interval smaller by adjusting for the
    weight we multiply the se by. This is the same we we subtract from
    pof_est and add to pof_est to get us our low and high range of the
    possibility of failure.

- Can you *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?

  - Yes because the variability from the method to calculate the POF is
    smaller then the variability we see within the given materials and
    curve we fit to the data.

## A different way to compute the POF

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Monte Carlo is a *general* way to estimate probabilities, but it
introduces approximation error. It turns out that, for the simple
problem we’re studying, we can compute the probability directly using
the CDF. Note that for our structural safety problem, we have

$$\text{POF} = \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0] = \mathbb{P}[S \leq L / A] = \text{CDF}_S(L/A).$$

Since
`S = rlnorm(n, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`, we
can use `plnorm` to compute the probability of failure without Monte
Carlo as
`POF = plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`.
Let’s combine this idea with the fitted distribution to estimate the
POF.

### **q5** Finish the following function by computing the POF with `plnorm()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## TODO: Complete the function below;
##       note that you only need to edit the TODO section

estimate_pof <- function(df) {
  ## Fit the distribution
  df_fit <-
    df %>%
    pull(strength) %>%
    fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
    tidy()

  ## Extract the parameters
  strength_meanlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "meanlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)
  strength_sdlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "sdlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)

## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure using plnorm
  pof_estimate <- plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)

  ## NOTE: No need to edit; this last line returns your pof_estimate
  pof_estimate
}

## NOTE: No need to edit; test your function
df_samples %>% estimate_pof()
```

    ## [1] 0.01832289

**Observations**:

- How does this estimate compare with your Monte Carlo estimate above?
  - It does and it fits into the interval we defined.
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo
  approximation*? Why or why not?
  - Since Monte Carlo is random points, there will be some variability
    in the assessment but plnorm handles that so there should be no
    uncertainty.
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo
  approximation* be induced or real?
  - Real because the variability is generated from the monte carlo
    method, not us measuring it.
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *limited physical
  tests*? Why or why not?
  - It does because we not only fitted a strength model to fill in for
    lack of physical tests we also too samples from that fitted model.
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *limited
  physical tests* be induced or real?
  - It would be induced because we are approximating measurements when
    we fit the curve, making the variability our creation, not an actual
    variability in measurements.

## Quantifying sampling uncertainty

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Using `plnorm()` gets rid of Monte Carlo error, but we still have
uncertainty due to limited physical testing. Often we can use a CLT
approximation to construct a confidence interval. However, with
`plnorm()` we can’t use a CLT approximation because it does not follow
the assumptions of the central limit theorem (it’s not a sum of iid
random variables). Instead, we can use the *bootstrap* to approximate a
confidence interval via resampling.

### **q6** The code below estimates a bootstrap CI on your POF estimate. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
tidycustom <- function(est) {tibble(term = "pof", estimate = est)}

df_samples %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimates = map(
      splits,
      ~ analysis(.x) %>% estimate_pof() %>% tidycustom()
    )
  ) %>%
  int_pctl(estimates)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   term   .lower .estimate .upper .alpha .method   
    ##   <chr>   <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>     
    ## 1 pof   0.00174    0.0181 0.0470   0.05 percentile

**Observations**:

- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *Monte Carlo approximation* of the POF? Why or why not?
  - Yes it does because plnorm should be able to handle that error that
    arises from the *Monte Carlo approximation.*
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  - It does because it takes that fitted model of the strength and then
    gets its approximation from sampling the data multiple times.
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - I can’t because the upper part of the interval is 0.045.
